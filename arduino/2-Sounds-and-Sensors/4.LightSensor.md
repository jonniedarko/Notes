#Light Sensor
We are now going to look at a new component known as a light-dependent resistor, or LDR. As the name implies, the device is a resistor that depends on light. In a dark environment, the resistor will have a very high resistance. As photons (light) land on the detector, the resistance will decrease. The more light there is, the lower the resistance will be. By reading the value from the sensor, we can detect if it is light, dark, or anywhere in-between. In this project, we will use an LDR to detect light and a piezo sounder to give audible feedback of the amount of the light detected.

####Connect It Up
First, make sure your Arduino is powered off by unplugging it from the USB cable. Then, connect up your parts so you have the circuit in image below. Check all of your connections before reconnecting the power to the Arduino.

The LDR can be inserted any way around; it does not have polarity. I found a 10kΩ resistor worked well with my LDR. You may need to try different resistor settings until you find one suitable for the LDR you have. A value between 1kΩ and 10kΩ should do the trick. Having a selection of different common resistor values in your component box will always come in handy.

####Enter the Code
Now fire up your Arduino IDE and enter the short and simple code below:

```c
// Project 14 - Light Sensor

int piezoPin = 8;  // Piezo on Pin 8
int ldrPin = 0;   // LDR on Analog Pin 0
int ldrValue = 0;  // Value read from the LDR

void setup() {
  // nothing to do here
}

void loop() {
        ldrValue = analogRead(ldrPin); // read the value from the LDR
        tone(piezoPin,1000); // play a 1000Hz tone from the piezo
        delay(25);  // wait a bit
        noTone(piezoPin);  // stop the tone
        delay(ldrValue); // wait the amount of milliseconds in ldrValue
}
```

When you upload this code to the Arduino, the Arduino will start to make short beeps. The gap between the beeps will be long if the LDR is in the shade and will be short when bright light is shone on it. This will give a Geiger counter-type effect, but with our detector detecting photon particles instead of ionizing radiation. You may find it more practical to solder a set of long wires to the LDR to allow you to keep your breadboard and Arduino on the table, but move your LDR around to point it at dark and light areas.

The code for this Project is very simple and you should be able to work out how it works yourself without any help. However, we will take a look at how an LDR works and why the additional resistor is important.

####Hardware Overview
The new component in this project is a light-dependent resistor (LDR), otherwise known as a CdS (cadmium sulfide) or photocell or photoresistor. LDRs . come in various shapes and sizes and in different ranges of resistance.


Each of the legs on the LDR go to an electrode on either side. Between the darker material, making a squiggly line between the electrodes, is the photoconductive material. The component has a transparent plastic or glass coating. When light hits the photoconductive material, it causes it to lose its resistance, allowing more current to flow between the electrodes.) LDRs can be used in all kinds of interesting projects. For example, you could fire a laser into an LDR and detect when a person breaks the beam, triggering an alarm or a shutter on a camera.

The next new thing in your circuit is a voltage divider (also known as a potential divider). This is where the resistor comes in. By using two resistors in series and taking the voltage across just one of them, you can reduce the voltage going into the circuit. In our case, we have a resistor of a fixed value (10kΩ or so) and a variable resistor in the form of a LDR. As it happens, the potentiometer used in Project 6 was also a voltage divider. Let us take a look at a standard voltage divider circuit using resistors and see how it works. In the following image we have a voltage divider using two resistors.

![voltage divider](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3673943/3596207/314915e4-0cc1-11e4-8399-c1acc4bfd5a0.jpg)

The voltage in (Vin) is connected across both resistors. When you measure the voltage across one of the )resistors (Vout), it will be less (divided). The formula for working out what the voltage at Vout is when measured across R2 is

```
Vout = ( R2 / (R2 + R1) ) x Vin
```

So, if in the circuit in Figure 4-6 we had 100Ω resistors (or 0.1kΩ) for both R1 and R2, and 5V going into Vin, our formula would be

```
( 100/ (100 +100)) x 5 = 2.5 volts
```

Let’s do it again with 470Ω resistors

```
( 470/ (470 +470)) x 5 = 2.5 volts
```

We get 2.5 volts again. This demonstrates that the value of the resistors is not important, but the ratio between them is. However, the value of the resistors will affect the amount of current drawn by the divider. The divider using 100 ohm resisters would use 4.7 times as much current as the one using 470 ohm resistors. Let’s try a 1kΩ and a 500Ω resistor

```
( 500/ (500 +1000)) x 5 = 1.66 volts
```

With the bottom resistor half the value of the top one, we get 1.66 volts, which is a third of the voltage going in. Let’s make the bottom resistor twice the value of the top at 2kΩ.

```
( 2000/ (2000 +1000)) x 5 = 3.33 volts
```

which is two thirds of the voltage going in. So, let’s apply this to the LDR. We shall presume that the LDR has a range of around 100kΩ when in the dark and 10kΩ in bright light. Table 4-4 shows what voltages we will get out of our circuit as the resistance changes.

| Light Level|    R1    |   R2      |  Vout |
| -----------|:--------:| ---------:|------:|
| Darkest    | 10K ohms | 100k ohms | 4.55v |
| 25%        | 10K ohms |  73k ohms | 4.40v |
| 50%        | 10K ohms |  45k ohms | 4.09v |
| 75%        | 10K ohms |  28k ohms | 3.68v |
| Lightest   | 10K ohms |  10k ohms |  2.5v |

As you can see, as the room brightness increases, the voltage at Vout decreases. As a result, the value we read at the sensor gets less and the delay after the beep is less, causing the beeps to occur more frequently. If you were to swap the resistor and LDR around, the voltage would increase as more light fell onto the LDR. Either way will work; it depends how you want your sensor to be read.
