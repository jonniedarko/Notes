#Using an L293D Motor Driver IC
In our previous project, we used a transistor to control the motor. In this project, we are going to use a very popular motor driver IC called an L293D. The advantage of using this chip is that we can control two motors at the same time, as well as control their direction. The chip can also be used to control a stepper motor, as we will find out in Project 28. There is also a pin-for-pin compatible chip available known as the SN754410, which can also be used and has a higher current rating. The IC has its own internal diodes, so we do not need one for this project
