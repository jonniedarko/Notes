#Dual 8-Bit Binary Counters

#Connect It Up
The first 595 is wired the same way as in the last Project. The second 595 has +5V and ground wires going to the same pins as on the first 595. Then, add a wire from pin 9 on IC 1 to pin 14 on IC 2. Add another from pin 11 on IC 1 to pin 11 on IC 2 and pin 12 on IC 1 to pin 12 on IC 2. Connect the capacitor between the supply and ground as before.
The same outputs as on the first 595 going to the first set of LEDs go from the second IC to the second set of LEDs.

####Enter the Code
Enter the following code and upload it to your Arduino. When you run this code, you will see the green set of LEDs count up (in binary) from 0 to 255 and the red LEDs count down from 255 to 0 at the same time.

```c
int latchPin = 8;  //Pin connected to Pin 12 of 74HC595 (Latch)
int clockPin = 12; //Pin connected to Pin 11 of 74HC595 (Clock)
int dataPin = 11;  //Pin connected to Pin 14 of 74HC595 (Data)

void setup() {
        //set pins to output
        pinMode(latchPin, OUTPUT);
        pinMode(clockPin, OUTPUT);
        pinMode(dataPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 255; i++) {                         //count from 0 to 255
                digitalWrite(latchPin, LOW);                     //set latchPin low to allow data flow
                shiftOut(dataPin, clockPin, LSBFIRST, i);       // shift out first 8 bits
                  shiftOut(dataPin, clockPin, LSBFIRST, 255-i); // shiftOut second 8 bits//set latchPin to high to lock and send data
                digitalWrite(latchPin, HIGH);
                delay(250 );
        }
}
```
The code for this Project is very similar to that of the last Project. We have simply added a second instruction to shift out another 8 bits to the second shift register. However, you will notice immediately that despite this being a more complex project than the last Project, we have less code. How is that? Well, you will notice that the shiftDataOut function has been replaced with shiftOut() and that this function is colored red in the Arduino IDE.  This is because the shiftOut command is an integral part of the Arduino language, as shifting out 8 bits of data to shift registers or LED controller ICs is used so commonly in the Arduino world that the ability to do so was introduced in the language.
The syntax for the shiftOut function is as follows:

```c
shiftOut(dataPin, clockPin, bitOrder, value)
```
The dataPin and clickPin were set at the start of the program and you set their pinMode to OUTPUT in the setup() loop. The bitOrder decides if the bits are shifted out starting with the most significant bit (the bit at the far left) or the least significant bit first (the bit at the far right of the 8). You use the words MSBFIRST for most significant bit first or LSBFIRST for the least significant bit first. We want to send out the least significant bit first, so we will be using LSBFIRST. Finally, the last value is the digit we are sending out. This is a byte as it is 8 bits maximum (0–255).

In the last project, we made our own shiftDataOut function that does exactly what shiftOut does. The reason I made you do this extra work was so that you could see exactly what was going on and how the shift register worked. This is essential knowledge for using shift registers. However, from now on we will use the shiftOut function.


In the main loop, the shiftOut routine sends 8 bits to the 595. In the main loop, we have put two sets of calls to shiftOut, one sending the value of I and the other sending 255-i. We call shiftOut twice before we set the latch to HIGH. This will send two sets of 8 bits, or 16 bits in total, to the 595 chips before the latch is set HIGH to copy the contents of the shift register to the output pins, which in turn make the LEDs go on or off.
The second 595 is wired exactly the same way as the first one. The clock and latch pins are tied to the same pins of the first 595. However, we have a wire going from pin 9 on IC 1 to pin 14 on IC 2. Pin 9 is the data output pin and pin 14 is the data input pin.


The data is input to pin 14 on the first IC from the Arduino. The second 595 chip is “daisy chained” to the first chip by pin 9 on IC 1, which is outputting data, into pin 14 on the second IC, which is the data input.

What happens is, as you enter a 9th bit and above, the data in IC 1 gets shunted out of its data pin and into the data pin of the second IC. So, once all 16 bits have been sent down the data line from the Arduino, the first 8 bits sent would have been shunted out of the first chip and into the second. The second 595 chip will contain the FIRST 8 bits sent out and the first 595 chip will contain the SECOND 8 bits, or bits 9 to 16.

An almost unlimited number of 595 chips can be daisy chained in this manner.

####EXERCISE
Exercise. Using the same circuit for this project and all 16 LEDs, recreate the Knight Rider (or Cylon) light effect, making the LEDs bounce back and forth across all 16 LEDs.
